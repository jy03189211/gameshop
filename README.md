## Goal

In this project, our goal is to make a game store for game developers to offer their games for sale and for players to buy those games. In addition, the games can be playable in an iframe element in the same store. The game store offers multiple different games and in our case the games are different versions of the same game that resembles flappy bird. What makes these games different from each other are the small details such as the changing player icon, background, degree of difficulty and possible control keys.

### Additional features

- Save/load and resolution feature
- 3rd party login
    - Our plan is to implement Google login provided by the Django social authentication mechanism
- RESTful API
- Own game
- Responsiveness
- Social media sharing

### Models

![models](https://git.niksula.hut.fi/palomar1/csc3170/raw/master/plan/models.png)

The backend includes the following object models:

- User

  Represents a user of the system. All users are players, but also developers. This model extends the default Django User model which already includes the basic authentication-related things, and the naming of this model is also thus likely to change a bit to not conflict with Django.

- Game

  Represents a game in the system. Added by a developer.

- Score

  Represents a high score result. Is created based on the information sent by the game when played.

- Order

  Represents a purchase of one or more games in a single transaction. A collection of Purchases.

- Purchase

  Represents a purchase of a single game.

- Savegame

  Represents a saved game state. Is created based on the information sent by the game when played. Can contain any data as determined by the game.
